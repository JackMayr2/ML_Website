        <p>
          This project is for the benefit of myself and anyone trying to learn about similar things.
    I hope to organize this site as a way of displaying what I have learned / done. In
    scientific studies and anecdotally, teaching is the best way to solidify learning. This site hopes to accomplish that for me
    as I try to explain what I have learned in my own words, as well as implement in examples.
