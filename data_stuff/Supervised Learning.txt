This article will be an overview of machine learning basics. This project is for the benefit of myself and anyone trying to learn about similar things.  I plan to organize this site as a way of displaying what I have learned/done. In scientific studies and anecdotally, teaching is the best way to solidify learning. This site hopes to accomplish that for me as I try to explain what I have learned in my own words, as well as implement examples.
